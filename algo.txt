Check if ball hits paddle
    ;Ball Data Storage - [oldxpos, oldypos, dx, dy, size, xpos, ypos]
    ;Paddle Data Storage - [xpos, ypos, speed, length, newx, newy]
    
    
    
    ;Algorithm
    ;if ball[4] < 0, it's heading towards the pad
    ;if ball[0] > pad[0], and ball[10] <= pad[0], it passes through the pad's xpos
    
    ;finally, we have two y-values to consider, the top and bottom of the ball
    ;for this part, we will consider the pad's & ball's new position, since the 
    ;player will be trying to move the pad to intercept the ball.
    
    ;if both are under the pad's ypos, or over the pad's ypos+length, ignore
    ;if this is not true, register a collision:
    ;negate ball[4], set ball[10]=pad[0]+1
